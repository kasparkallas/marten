The Marten library provides .NET developers with the ability to use the proven [PostgreSQL database engine](http://www.postgresql.org/) and its [fantastic JSON support](https://www.compose.io/articles/is-postgresql-your-next-json-database/) as a fully fledged [document database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database). The Marten team believes that a document database has far reaching benefits for developer productivity over relational databases with or without an ORM tool.

Marten also provides .NET developers with an ACID-compliant event store with user-defined projections against event streams.

## Working with the Code

Before getting started you will need the following in your environment:

**1. .NET Core SDK 3.1 (or higher)**

Available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)

**2. .NET Framework 4.6.1 Developer Pack**

Available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/net461-developer-pack)

**3. PostgreSQL 9.5 or above database with PLV8**

The fastest possible way to develop with Marten is to run PostgreSQL in a Docker container. Assuming that you have
Docker running on your local box, type `dotnet run -- init-db` at the command line to spin up a Postgresql database with
PLv8 enabled and configured in the database. The default Marten test configuration tries to find this database if no
PostgreSQL database connection string is explicitly configured following the steps below:

You need to enable the PLV8 extension inside of PostgreSQL for running JavaScript stored procedures for the nascent projection support.

Ensure the following:

- The login you are using to connect to your database is a member of the `postgres` role
- An environment variable of `marten_testing_database` is set to the connection string for the database you want to use as a testbed. (See the [Npgsql documentation](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html) for more information about PostgreSQL connection strings ).

_Help with PSQL/PLV8_

- On Windows, see [this link](http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/360-PLV8-binaries-for-PostgreSQL-9.5-windows-both-32-bit-and-64-bit.html) for pre-built binaries of PLV8
- On *nix, check [marten-local-db](https://github.com/eouw0o83hf/marten-local-db) for a Docker based PostgreSQL instance including PLV8.

Once you have the codebase and the connection string file, run the [build command](https://github.com/JasperFx/marten#build-commands) or use the dotnet CLI to restore and build the solution.

You are now ready to contribute to Marten.

### Tooling

* Unit Tests rely on [xUnit](http://xunit.github.io/) and [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly)
* [Bullseye](https://github.com/adamralph/bullseye) is used for build automation.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runs our Mocha specs.
* [Storyteller](http://storyteller.github.io) for some of the data intensive automated tests

> Note: You should have a running Postgres instance while running unit tests or StoryTeller tests.

### xUnit.Net Specs

To aid in integration testing, Marten.Testing has a couple reusable base classes that can be use
to make integration testing through Postgresql be more efficient and allow the xUnit.Net tests
to run in parallel for better throughput.

* `IntegrationContext` -- if most of the tests will use an out of the box configuration
  (i.e., no fluent interface configuration of any document types), use this base type. Warning though,
  this context type will **not** clean out the main `public` database schema between runs,
  but will delete any existing data
* `DestructiveIntegrationContext` -- similar to `IntegrationContext`, but will wipe out any and all
  Postgresql schema objects in the `public` schema between tests. Use this sparingly please.
* `OneOffConfigurationsContext` -- if a test suite will need to frequently re-configure
  the `DocumentStore`, this context is appropriate. You will need to decorate any of these
  test classes with the `[Collection]` attribute, typically using the schema name for the 
  collection name as a convention
* `BugIntegrationContext` -- the test harnesses for bugs tend to require custom `DocumentStore`
  configuration, and this context is a specialization of `OneOffConfigurationsContext` for
  the *bugs* schema. 
* `StoreFixture` and `StoreContext` are helpful if a series of tests use the same custom
  `DocumentStore` configuration. You'd need to write a subclass of `StoreFixture`, then use
  `StoreContext<YourNewStoreFixture>` as the base class to share the `DocumentStore` between
  test runs with xUnit.Net's shared context (`IClassFixture<T>`)

### Mocha Specs

Refer to the build commands section to look up the commands to run Mocha tests. There is also `npm run tdd` to run the mocha specifications
in a watched mode with growl turned on. 

> Note: remember to run `npm install`

### Storyteller Specs

Refer to build commands section to look up the commands to open the StoryTeller editor or run the StoryTeller specs.

### Documentation

The documentation content is the markdown files in the `/documentation` directory directly under the project root. To run the documentation website locally with auto-refresh, refer to the build commands section above.

If you wish to insert code samples to a documentation page from the tests, wrap the code you wish to insert with
`// SAMPLE: name-of-sample` and `// ENDSAMPLE`.
Then to insert that code to the documentation, add `<[sample:name-of-sample]>`.

> Note: content is published to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository. Refer to build commands section to lookup the command for publishing docs.
